## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- During this course I have learned about the many types, categories and methods of testing which opened me to explore more or focus on particular methods/frameworks that can serve in my future career (as developer). Project helped me putting that knowledge to practice as it looks simple to only think about writting bug report or test case but writting it down, properly, so nothing is ambiguous or missed, is not as simple anymore.
